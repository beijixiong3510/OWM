### There is a new version based on TF2  https://github.com/xuejianyong/OWM-tf2 provided by Dr. Jianyong Xue, and it basically reproduces our work. Thanks to all researchers who care about and support our work!

## Requirements

### If the environment configurations are different, the results may vary greatly  or even failing to work properly. You may need to adjust the code details according to your needs.
